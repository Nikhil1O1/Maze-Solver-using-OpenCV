# Maze Solver using OpenCV
 This project uses python and OpenCV to solve given maze images.
 The program first converts entire given image into b&w and further refines the image to properly distinguish the maze cells.
 Further BFS is applied to find all possible paths and later the shortest path (calculated using coordinate system) is returned with all the necessary coordinates to plot the path on the image.
